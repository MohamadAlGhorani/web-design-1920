      <li class="interviewer">You and I met at Epicurrence, and, um, this, this story that you shared on stage was so touching and emotional and honest and re- revealing and vulnerable.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">I think everybody was like either crying inside or the outside, one of those.</li>
      <li class="gast">Ooh! ðŸ˜‡</li>
      <li class="interviewer">And, uh, I, I, I, I know that, uh, the- there wasn't a lot of notification for you to prepare,</li>
      <li class="interviewer">and so that made your talk even more remarkable, and the courage that you had to come up on stage and share your story.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">You and I have been doing this dance for a number of months, maybe a two-</li>
      <li class="gast">Years</li>
      <li class="interviewer">... two years, I don't know. It's been a little time.</li>
      <li class="gast">Years, maybe. I don't know.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">Uh, and I, I'm not counting. But you and I are having lunch. And I'm like, "You know, I w- I wish these were recorded, so somehow I convince you to like, let's just, let's just try. And I think-</li>

      <li class="gast">You're, you're a wizard there because, uh, it was a fight or flight moment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. And you won me over.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I'm glad I did, uh, because I think the way that you look at the world and the things that you have to share are worth sharing.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">You know TED Talk, their, their motto is ideas worth sharing. And I watch so many of them, like, that's not worth sharing.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">But you on the other hand I think you have something, a message that's so different that cuts through all the superficiality, and you get right to the core and story after story.</li>
      <li class="interviewer">I'm thinking we need to share this with the world. And so let's get right into it. Okay.</li>
      <li class="gast">Okay. So, should we talk about how Epicurrence came about?</li>
      <li class="interviewer">We can. You wanna start there?</li>
      <li class="gast">Well, because you brought it up and you said I had such a short time.</li>
